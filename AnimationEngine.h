/* Animation Types
 * Show     - Just update leds based on led data. (overwrites)
 * Blank    - Set all off (overwrites)
 * Dim      - Decrease each chanel of each led by n (modifies)
 * Saturate - Increase each LED's color intensity by n (modifies)
 * Shift    - Move the pattern towards the end of the string (modifies) *
 * bShift   - Move the pattern towards the front of the string (modifies) *
 * Diffuse  - Blur the string (bleed each pixel on to its neighbors) (modifies)
 * Scramb   - Swap pixels randomly every n milliseconds (modifies)
 * Blink    - Flash between the existing pattern and black! n (ms) period (Combinable!)
 *            [Run blink after another time based effect in order to combine the blinking with the prior effect.]
 * Delay    - Hold the existing pattern on the display for n milliseconds.
 * HueShift - Rotate the hue once around the color wheel
 * Twinkle  - Flash your led data color palette randomly on the strip with a decay effect between flashes.
 * Spazz    - Cycle through your led data color pallette on each LED quickly (out of phase) for a dazling effect) for n ms
 * add      - Add to all LEDs from led data (modifies)
 * randadd  - Add random color to a random location (modifies)
 * (ADD MORE NEW ANIMATION TYPES HERE!)
